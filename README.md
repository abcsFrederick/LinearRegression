# Statistics for Lunch: Linear Regression

Welcome to the repository for the linear regression materials for Statistics for Lunch! There are two main branches in this repository:

## Master

The master branch is where the exercises for the hands-on session are located as well as the code used to generate the slides for the lecture.

* Files located in the `docs/` directory were used to generate the lecture slides. The slides are located there as well, but click [here](http://abcsFrederick.github.io/LinearRegression/slides.html) to view the slides.
    * `slides.Rmd` contains the slides for the lecture.
    * `slideNotes.md` contains notes for the slides if you missed the lecture.

## Solutions

The solutions branch is where solutions to the hands-on practice problems will be deposited.
